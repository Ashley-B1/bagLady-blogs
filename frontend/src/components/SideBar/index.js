            Hello World! My name is Skye and I am a frontend developer who took her love of technology and art and turned it into a career. I'm here to break the barriers down for women, especially WOC in the STEM field. The first time I ever touched a computer was in 1999! I was 2 years old when my granny, a former Apple employee, introduced me to the World Wide Web. We used to play games on her computer as a form of bonding. It's quite odd to say my granny was myÂ gateway to technology, but it's true. My granny was a tech savvy woman who passed her love for modern technology down to me. Now that I have the torch, I want ignite the path for other women to take charge in the tech field.
